This package implement the algorithm described in the following paper:
Zou, Xiaorong
"Structured Factor Model and its Applications on Market Risk Management"
the paper can be found in: <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3180413>

The algorithm is implemented in class sfm.py.  testing driver with input file is provided. 

files description: 
main.py: the testing driver 
sfm.py:  the class for the algorithm
util_sfm.py and utility.py contain some utility functions for testing purpose. 
model_N50_m2_s23222.xlsx:  the input fule of the testing 

this package is not for public at this time.   please contact xiaorzou@gmail.com if you are intersted in relevant research in this area. I can share certain info about the implemeation, but not the source code.
